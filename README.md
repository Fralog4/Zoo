**A Programming Zoo**

Embark on a virtual zoo where we explore the fascinating world of animal classification, inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation. This project delves into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to simulate different animal types and their unique characteristics.

**Inheriting the Animal: A Family Tree of Traits**

Just like species in the natural world, classes in OOP share common traits and ancestry through inheritance. The `Animal` class serves as the foundation, representing the fundamental traits of all animals. Specific animal types, such as `Lion`, `Tiger`, `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Wolf`, inherit from the `Animal` class, gaining access to its methods and attributes while also defining their own distinct traits.

**Paws for a Treat: Identifying Pet-Friendly Animals**

Some animals, like dogs and cats, are often considered pets due to their behaviors that make them suitable for domestic life. Interfaces in OOP allow us to define a set of behaviors that classes can adopt. The `Pet` interface outlines the characteristics of a pet, including the ability to make a sound and perform tricks. Classes like `Dog` and `Cat` can implement the `Pet` interface, conforming to these behaviors and becoming eligible for designation as pets.

**Protecting Animal Data: Encapsulation**

Just like keeping animal health records confidential, encapsulation in OOP safeguards sensitive data within a class. Animal classes utilize encapsulation by defining private attributes for their sensitive information. Public getter and setter methods provide controlled access to this data, ensuring its integrity and protecting it from unintended modifications.

**Exploring OOP Principles: A Programming Safari**

Our Wild Kingdom project demonstrates the practical application of inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation in object-oriented programming. By creating a virtual zoo with various animal types, we effectively showcase the concepts of inheritance, allowing classes to inherit traits from other classes; interfaces, enabling classes to adopt specific behaviors; and encapsulation, safeguarding sensitive data through controlled access.

It serves as a stepping stone for exploring more complex OOP concepts and building robust and well-structured applications.

**Abstract Classes: Simplifying Animal Classification**

To further organize our zoo's animals, we utilize abstract classes to represent higher-level taxonomic groups. The `Feline` abstract class captures the shared characteristics of felines, such as sharp claws and retractable teeth. Similarly, the `Canine` abstract class encapsulates the traits of canines, including sharp teeth and pack-hunting behavior.

This project draws significant inspiration from the textbook "Head First Java" third edition.
